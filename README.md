# How to setup the sql_database.py file
- There are two sql_database.py files. (sql_database.py (windows), sql_database_linux.py (linux))
- Rename the file you need to sql_database.py and delete the other.
- Then delete the example.html from the html folder.

# Commands
- `!lektier` shows the next assignment.
- `!lektier [count]` (!lektier 3) shows the next 3 assignments.
- `!updatedb` updates the database with new homework/assignments.
- `!help` shows commands that anyone can run.
